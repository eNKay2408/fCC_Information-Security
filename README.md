# fCC_Information-Security
Here are some of my "Information Security" Projects on freeCodeCamp

## 1. Stock Price Checker
- **Introduction**: This is my first security project. I don't think just setting headers to the http response will increase security, it's really simple.
- **Skills**: Express, Helmet, Chai, MongoDB, Bcrypt.
- **Purposes**: Get the stock price from an external API. Allow users to like the stock. Compare the number of likes between two stocks.

## 2. Anonymous Message Board
- **Introduction**: I think this project is more interesting than the first one. I have to implement the authentication and authorization system.
- **Skills**: Express, Helmet, Chai, MongoDB, Bcrypt, Authentication, Authorization.
- **Purposes**: Create a new thread, reply to a thread, report a thread, delete a thread, report a reply, delete a reply.

## 3. Port Scanner
- **Introduction**: This is a simple port scanner. But it took me quite a while to figure out how to validate between IP and host formats.

## 4. SHA1 Password Cracker

## 5. Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game
